## 🧠 About Me

I’m focused on building intelligent security solutions that detect, classify, and respond to real-world threats.

Currently building a robust ML-powered phishing detection system and automating SOC workflows using open-source tools. My work blends traditional detection engineering with modern machine learning techniques — all backed by hands-on experimentation in my custom home lab.
