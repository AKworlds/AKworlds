## 🧠 About Me

I'm a cybersecurity student learning how to secure networks—and along the way, I discovered a deep interest in using AI and ML to improve threat detection and response. My projects focus on building smarter, automated security tools that go beyond signature-based defenses.

I enjoy building hands-on labs, automating incident workflows, and integrating multiple tools to create practical, scalable detection systems.
